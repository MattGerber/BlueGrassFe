a. How long the assessment took you in man hours?
I would approximate about 16 hours spread across 4 days, I did have to slot in time in between other responsibilities.


b. List any functionality you were not able to complete or known issues within the code you were not able
to resolve?
SOme Ui elements are not a picture perfect match, but I do believe that is mainly due to not knowing what css library or framework was considered when creating the design

c. What parts of the test were most challenging to you?
I took this test as an oppurtunity to learn and decided to use Material UI for the first time. I have also never worked with figma before, so it took me some time to learn how to properly inspect and drill down into individual components
